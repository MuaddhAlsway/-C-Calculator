This project aims to build a calculator that 
can perform simple arithmetic  operations and 
display the results to users.



Learning outcomes:

- Understanding of variables, data types, and operators in C
- Use of multiple library functions and work with user input
- Implementation of control flow statements like if-else statements or switch statements 
- Performing basic arithmetic operations 

What it takes to execute this C programming project:

- Include the stdio.h library for input-output operations in C.
- Define the main() function where our code execution begins.
    -- Inside the main function, 
    declare three variables: a, b, and choice
- Ask the user to enter two integer numbers
        and store them in variables a and b using the scanf() 
        function.
- Provide the user with choices for different 
    calculator operations and store their choice in the
     ‘choice’ variable.
- Using a switch statement, check the user’s choice.
    For example, if the choice is 1, 
    we perform addition (a + b); 
    for choice 2, we perform subtraction, 
    and so on, and display the result.
- In the case of division, we check if 
    the divisor b is not zero before performing the division to avoid 
        a division-by-zero error
    If the user enters a choice that is not 
        in the provided list, the default case
        is executed, and an error message is printed.
